    Netlist class parses a circuit netlist and applies modifications. Subclassed

        netlist (tuple/list): Netlist in newline separated definitions.

    Instance Attributes:
        path (str): Filepath of netlist file (default empty string).
        directives (dict): Commands/definitions in the netlist. Stored as
            type: Directive instance.

    Class Attributes:
        prior_directives (tuple): A tuple of directive types that must be put
            before element definitions. Specific to Ahkab library which requires
            'model' directives before element definitions.

            as Directive instances. For e.g. .subckt and .ends are parsed as
