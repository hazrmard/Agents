"""
Contains on-policy temporal difference agents:

* N-step SARSA

Note: On-policy agents are better for value function approximation since
they use the action selection policy to estimate future returns (as opposed
to off-policy algorithms like q-learning which uses the *most* valuable
state/action pair as a value backup). Therefore the expected future returns
will reflect the true value of states (and not a biased estimate).

        Calls the n-step SARSA `episodes` times.

        Args:
        * episodes: Number of eposides to learn over.
        * policy (str): The action selection policy. Used durung learning/
        exploration to randomly select actions from a state. One of
        `agent.[UNIFORM | GREEDY | SOFTMAX]`. Default UNIFORM.
        * episolon: A `Schedule` instance describing how the exploration rate
        changes for each episode (for GREEDY policy).
        * discount: The discount level for future rewards. Between 0 and 1. If -1,
        then return is average of rewards instead of a discounted sum.
        * steps: The number of steps to accumulate reward.
        * maxsteps: Number of steps at most to take if episode continues.
        * memsize: Size of experience memory. Default 1 most recent observation.
        * batchsize: Number of past experiences to replay. Default 1.
        
        If a parameter is a `Schedule`, it is evaluated for each episode and
        passed as a number.

        Returns:
        * An array of rewards for each episode.
